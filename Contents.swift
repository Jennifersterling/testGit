////print ("Hi Brandi" + " Hi Corey")

//
////Idea: design Our code to be able to take anything we wwant to say, and put what we want to say out on the console. Our first function:
////camelcase: spaces are bad, so when we name somethi g, make it one word.
////first word not capitalized, everywhere after: capitalized
////inside(): your parameters: what goes into the funtcion
//// :--> "of type
////we made our function here
//func outputName(userInput: String) {
//
//// our function goes here
//print("\(userInput)")
//}
////test our function
//var test = "It is raining, and I thought Miami would be sunny."
//outputName(userInput: test)
//
//5<3
//12>7
//6 != 8
//7==7
//
//var luckyNum = 7
//luckyNum < 10
//luckyNum == 7

var dogAge = 5
if dogAge < 2 {
    print("you are a puppy!")
}
else if dogAge > 12 {
    print("You are elderly!")
}
else {
    print("You are also awesome!")
}
